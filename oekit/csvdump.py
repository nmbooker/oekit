"""A library to help with dumping out data from OpenERP models as CSV.

It's intended mostly for allowing you to get a quick view of the data in
a table while at a Python prompt, but you could us it in other programs
too.

I plan to include a generic command-line dumper script based on the
functionality in here.

The highest-level function you can use here is dump_csv.

Otherwise you can use a combination of:
    * one of get_all_rows, get_search_rows or get_rows
    * write_rows
